    Automate Playlist Creation using Python
</div>

If you've used Spotify before you would have noticed the awesome [Discover Weekly playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXcQ9COmYvdajy). As the name suggests, it uses Spotify recommendation system to create a weekly playlist of songs that you'll like. The only problem is that it updates every week and deletes old playlists that you might have enjoyed. You have to be dilligent in starring your favorite songs or saving the playlist manually.

This is a fun project using python was inspired by my desire to explore the Spotify API and automate saving of the Discover Weekly playlist. 

The [code repository](https://github.com/sshourie/SpotifyPlaylistCreater/tree/main) is simple and self explanatory but requires API keys from Spotify.
