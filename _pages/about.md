Iâ€™m a graduate student currently pursuing my MS in Computational analytics at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.analytics.gatech.edu/) with a focus on Machine Learning and statistical methods.

I'm currently working as a data scientist intern at [BBDO Atlanta](https://bbdoatl.com/). 

I have previously worked for 5 years in different analytical roles in the field of finance.

See my [Projects](/projects/) to see examples of Data Science solutions!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
